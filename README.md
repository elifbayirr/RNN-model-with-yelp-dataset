# RNN-model-with-yelp-dataset

RNN is a network that can calculate the relationship between these long-term dependencies. In people's behaviors, speech and thoughts, the information that was previously in memory, like this structure, is processed by looping with new data in a hidden layer.
 
My code is in the "1. implementation" file.

It is given in the data set that you will work on yelp dataset.
